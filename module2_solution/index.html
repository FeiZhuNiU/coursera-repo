                instructions on how to
                create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub
                Pages,
                i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide that URL for your peer review.

            <p class="details">Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in
                the desktop
                view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/”lorem ipsum”, it doesn’t matter. How
                the
                sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window. (Hint: use media queries
                discussed in Lecture 23.)

    <section id="Sushi">
        <div class="inner_div">
            <p class="sub_title">Sushi</p>
            <p class="details">Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is always
                positioned at the top
                right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the
                mockup
                illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute
                positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)
